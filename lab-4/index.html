        <h2>PROJECT’S</h2>
        <p1>Drowsiness Detection System Using Open CV</p1>
        <p1>Developed a Machine Learning model using Deep-Learning Algorithm, to detect Drowsiness Detection system along with validating input ﬁle for a valid data set. 
            The output indicates if a person feel’s drowsiness or not. This was done as a main project during my academic’s time to improve my understanding of algorithms 
            and learn how machine learning can solve real life problems.</p1>

        <h2>PUBLICATION</h2>
        <p3>• Published a journal on Drowsiness Detection System with Machine Learning and open cv in - IJCRT International with a team of 4 and a mentor.</p3>
        <p3>•  Drowsiness Detection System is used to Detect Drowsiness of a person while driving. Driver fatigue typically becomes an instantaneous reason behind several traffic accidents.
             In this manner, there’s a thought to create the framework that will distinguish and inform a driver of his/her terrible psychophysical condition. 
             Which may essentially diminish the number of fatigue-related car mishaps </p3>

    <h3>ADDENDUM</h3>
    <h4>Font Choices:</h4>
    <p8>  For this resume, a variety of font families have been selected to create a visually appealing and dynamic layout. The heading font "Arial" exudes professionalism, while the subheading font "Georgia" adds a touch of sophistication. In the body text, the "Roboto" font strikes a balance between readability and modernity, ensuring that information is presented clearly and effectively. Additionally, specific font families have been assigned to certain sections to further enhance the visual hierarchy and readability.</p8>
        
    <h5> Heading and Text Sizes: </h5>
    <p9>    The heading size has been set to a larger font size (h1) to draw attention to key sections such as the individual's name and job title. Subheadings (h2) are slightly smaller to provide a clear hierarchy within each section. The body text (p) is kept at a standard size for easy reading and comprehension.
    </p9>  
    <h6>Color Choices: </h6>
    <p10>   Color plays a crucial role in the overall aesthetic of the resume. The heading background color "skyblue" creates a visually appealing contrast against the lightgrey text, ensuring that key information stands out. Subheadings are distinguished by the green color, adding a pop of color to the document. For the body text, a classic black color is chosen for optimal readability against the white background.
    </p10>    
    <h7>Margin and Padding Choices: </h7>
    <p11>   Margin and padding settings have been applied to various elements to ensure adequate spacing and visual clarity. Margins have been set at 20px to provide breathing room around the entire document, while individual sections have a bottom margin of 20px to separate content effectively. Padding of 10px is applied to headings to add space between the text and the surrounding elements, enhancing readability.
